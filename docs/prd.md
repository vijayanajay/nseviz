Product Requirements Document: Visual Market Pulse Dashboard (Frontend)

1. Introduction
This document outlines the frontend requirements for the Visual Market Pulse Dashboard, a web application designed to provide users with an intuitive, visualization-driven overview of the Indian stock market, initially focusing on the Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50 indices. The core philosophy emphasizes minimal text, direct interaction with visual elements, and progressive disclosure of information. Data is sourced via backend APIs, which in turn use Yahoo Finance (yfinance). This PRD focuses exclusively on the client-side/frontend components and interactions.

2. Goals
Provide a highly scannable, visual overview of market health (Nifty 50, Nifty Next 50).
Enable intuitive drill-down into specific indices and individual stocks through direct interaction with visualizations.
Deliver a clean, minimalist, and responsive user experience across desktop and mobile devices using Bootstrap.
Ensure rapid comprehension of stock/index performance through consistent color-coding (red/green).

(Note: Purely visual color coding for meaning presents an accessibility challenge; consider alternative indicators like icons or patterns for future enhancement).
NFR-08: Data Handling
Display data fetched from the backend API accurately.
Provide clear visual indication if data is loading or unavailable.
Display data source attribution (Yahoo Finance) and any required disclaimers (e.g., in the footer).
5. User Workflows & Journeys (User Story Mapping - Examples)
Journey 1: Quick Market Scan
Goal: Understand the overall market mood in < 30 seconds.
Steps:
User opens the application URL.
System: Displays Homepage (FEAT-001) with Nifty 50 heatmap.
User scans the colors of the heatmap tiles.
User hovers/tap-holds on a bright red tile (FEAT-002).
System: Shows tooltip with Stock Name, % Loss, Volume.
User hovers/tap-holds on a bright green tile (FEAT-002).
System: Shows tooltip with Stock Name, % Gain, Volume.
Friction Points: Heatmap too slow to load? Tooltip laggy? Colors not distinct enough?
Journey 2: Investigate Specific Stock from Homepage

Steps:
User is on the Homepage (FEAT-001).
User identifies and clicks/taps on the tile for "RELIANCE".
System: Navigates to the Stock Detail Page for RELIANCE (FEAT-003).
User views the Key Info Bar (Price, Change).
User examines the 1D Stock Price Chart (FEAT-004).
User clicks the "1M" timeframe button (FEAT-005 - Post-MVP).
System: Updates the chart to show 1 Month data.
User scrolls down to view Key Metrics (FEAT-006).
User clicks the "Back" button/uses browser back (FEAT-012).
System: Returns to the Homepage.
Friction Points: Tile hard to click accurately? Page transition slow? Chart update slow? Metrics unclear? Navigation confusing?
Journey 3: Explore an Index (Post-MVP)
Goal: See the performance of the Nifty 50 index and its constituents.
Steps:
User is on the Homepage (FEAT-001).

System: Navigates to that Stock's Detail Page (FEAT-003).
Friction Points: Index entry point unclear? Index chart confusing? Gainers/losers data slow?
6. Technical Feasibility & Architecture (Conceptual Frontend)
Approach: Use HTMX for dynamic content loading (tooltips, partial updates, chart data switching, index details) where backend returns HTML fragments. Use Alpine.js for small, self-contained UI interactions (e.g., toggling active state on chart timeframe buttons, simple UI toggles/animations not covered by HTMX). All backend logic and data APIs are provided by a Flask API. Frontend and backend are strictly separated: all data and dynamic HTML fragments are fetched from the Flask API; no backend logic or templates are mixed into the frontend codebase.
Core Technologies:
HTML5
Bootstrap (for layout, responsiveness, and theming)
HTMX (for tooltips, dynamic content loading, partial updates)
Alpine.js (for local UI state, toggles, simple interactivity)
Lightweight Charting Library (e.g., Chart.js, ApexCharts, Frappe Charts)

Backend: Flask API (serves all data and HTML fragments, no frontend logic)

    end

Technical Constraints & Dependencies:
- Strict separation: Frontend and backend codebases are independent. No backend templates or logic in frontend.
- HTMX is used for all dynamic content loading from backend (tooltips, partial page updates, chart data, index details, etc.).
- Alpine.js is used for local UI state and simple interactivity not covered by HTMX (e.g., toggling active state on chart timeframe buttons).
- Flask API provides all data and HTML fragments. No direct database or business logic in frontend.
- Charting library must be lightweight and integrate with HTMX/Alpine.js.
- Bootstrap is used for all layout, responsiveness, and theming. No custom Vanilla CSS or other CSS frameworks/preprocessors.
- All API endpoints and data contracts are defined in Flask backend.
- Performance and user experience depend on efficient Flask API responses and optimized frontend rendering.
- HTMX and Alpine.js integration must be clean and minimal, following best practices for separation and maintainability.
7. Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax - Examples)
Feature: FEAT-001: Homepage Market Heatmap
Scenario: Displaying Nifty 50 Heatmap on Load
Given the user navigates to the application's root URL
When the page assets (HTML, CSS, JS) are loaded and initial API call completes
Then a section titled or clearly representing "Nifty 50" is visible
And it contains multiple rectangular tiles
And each tile corresponds to a stock in the Nifty 50 index
And tiles for stocks with positive daily % change have a green background
And tiles for stocks with negative daily % change have a red background
And the intensity of green/red correlates with the magnitude of the % change
Feature: FEAT-002: Stock Tile Tooltip (HTMX)
Scenario: User hovers over a stock tile on desktop
Given the Homepage heatmap (FEAT-001) is displayed
When the user places their mouse cursor over the tile representing "INFY"
Then a tooltip appears adjacent to the "INFY" tile within 200ms
And the tooltip contains the text "Infosys Ltd." (or full name)
And the tooltip contains the current daily percentage change for INFY (e.g., "+1.25%")
And the tooltip contains the current daily volume change for INFY (e.g., "+5.0%")
When the user moves their mouse cursor off the "INFY" tile
Then the tooltip disappears.
Feature: FEAT-005: Chart Timeframe Selection (Post-MVP)
Scenario: Changing stock chart timeframe
Given the user is viewing the Stock Detail Page (FEAT-003) for "RELIANCE"
And the Stock Price Chart (FEAT-004) is displaying the "1D" timeframe by default
And timeframe selection buttons "1D", "5D", "1M", "6M", "1Y", "Max" are visible
When the user clicks the "6M" timeframe button
Then the Stock Price Chart updates within 1 second to show the 6-Month price history for "RELIANCE"
And the "6M" button becomes visually highlighted as the active selection
And the "1D" button is no longer highlighted as active.
